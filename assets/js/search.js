    "body": "Example Markdown PostBasic setup: Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename. md Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. . md is the file extension for markdown files. The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a ‚Äúlevel 1 heading‚Äù in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. Basic formatting: You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here‚Äôs a footnote 1.

Purchased ‚ÄúThe Art of Statistics‚Äù from Amazon for $30 Statistics has played a leading role in our scientific understanding of the world for centuries, yet we are all familiar with the way statistical claims can be sensationalised, particularly in the media. In the age of big data, as data science becomes established as a discipline, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever. In The Art of Statistics, David Spiegelhalter guides the reader through the essential principles we need in order to derive knowledge from data. Drawing on real world problems to introduce conceptual issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether serial killer Harold Shipman could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. How many trees are there on the planet? Do busier hospitals have higher survival rates? Why do old men have big ears? Spiegelhalter reveals the answers to these and many other questions - questions that can only be addressed using statistical science. https://dspiegel29. github. io/ArtofStatistics/       [The Art of Statistics: Code, Data, Errata and Additions   ArtofStatistics](https://dspiegel29. github. io/ArtofStatistics/)   "

For example: Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contentsSetting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README.
