I purchased a new bike on Saturday, went a little over budget so I walked into the city (8km), picked it up and was riding home and I got a bloody nail through the tyre, so another 4 km walking :-(

So far, I like it. It is very responsive, easy to accelerate. My goal with the bike is to lose 20kg over the Australian summer and build a good physical base.
